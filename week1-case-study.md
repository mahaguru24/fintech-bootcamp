## Overview and Origin

### Banxa
* When was the company incorporated?
* Who are the founders of the company?
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 

Domenic Carosa Australin born nerdy businessman started to minig bitcoin. While mining they spun up the website called bitcoin.com.au. The company was founded in 2014. Dominic spotted that there is a gap for fiat on ramps solution. Which means, there are not much players who providing facility to convert fiat (forex) money to crypto. 

Converting fiat to crypto is one part of company services another big part is following all the compliance standards e.g. KYC & wallet vaildations.

Banxa was really born out of my nerdish interest in blockchain. In 2013/14 I began by mining bitcoin—I’ve always learned best by doing, and so we started there. From that, we spun up bitcoin.com.au, a site where retail/end users could buy bitcoin. Eventually on the back of that, in the 2017/18’s bull market, we rode the wave and scaled pretty quickly. On the back end of that we went through the contraction, same as many other crypto companies.
 
Based on curchbase.com data Banxa had 2 funding rounds.In round A 2 million were raised & in round B CA$15,000,000
were raised so in toal $13.9M were raised over 2 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Apr 8, 2021 from a Post-IPO Equity round. Also they registered the company on Canadian Stock exchange because of ASX restricions on Crypto companies.
