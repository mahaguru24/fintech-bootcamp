Domenic Carosa, an Australian-born nerdy businessman, started mining bitcoin in the early days of bitcoin; while mining, he & his friends spun up a website called bitcoin.com.au. From there, Banxa was founded & they were officially registered themselves in 2014. Dominic spotted a market gap for fiat on and off-ramps solutions. Facility to convert fiat (forex) money to Crypto and vice versa respectively means on & off-ramp solution.

Also, they registered the company on the Canadian Stock exchange because of ASX restrictions on Crypto companies. Mainly the funding is used in increasing tech & compliance teams.

## Landscape: 
Banxa is identified as a Payments Service Provider, but fiat to Crypto conversion separates them from traditional PSPs. Traditional PSPs mainly focus on fiat transactions between merchant & customer. The market is scarce for on & off ramp PSPs.
Companies in the space need to be on top of their game as blockchain & Crypto space is continuously evolving & exploding. The main challenge or trend for companies in similar space are keeping up with crypto innovations. For example, recently, there was the Ether layer2 blockchain release, then companies need to provide the functionality to transact on layer2. Also, companies need to be able to add all new emerging coins & existing fiat currencies.
The space is still new. Thus Banxa does not have much competition, but their main competition is Simplex & Moonpay. Simplex is also a trusted third-party payment service provider used by Binance & Kucoin. However, Simplex is mainly focused on card payments & provides other services such as Crypto Debit Card. Both companies differ, but their core service is the same as on & off ramp solutions. Another Monday is a fierce competition; they recently closed their funding round with Billion dollar evaluation. However, Monday is also mainly in card space. Banxa does have a competitive advantage because of local payment methods. Thus, Banxa will fight hard to maintain that advantage.

## Recommendations 
Banxa can offer automatic timely investment options for clients. This feature will ensure a minimum fixed number of transactions & revenue for the company. This functionality can be implemented using ML/AI as this will help to predict the appropriate time in a timely investment.  
Banxa also provides a zero chargeback guarantee; this will also help Banxa match its competitors. 
Banxa has not tapped into the NFT & Defi Space; however, competitors provide these services. Once Banxa starts providing these solutions, they will be capturing a more significant market segment. They need to leverage blockchain technology to provide these services, which is Banxa's core strength.
